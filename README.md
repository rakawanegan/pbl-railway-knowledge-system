## Introduction

The system is designed to help railway operators make decisions more efficiently and safely. The system uses AI technologies such as LLM, ReAct, and AutoGen to provide support for various tasks in railway operations. The system can help operators with tasks such as summarizing operation information, responding to inquiries, creating manuals, and analyzing operation data.
