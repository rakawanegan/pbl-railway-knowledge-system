# Explain of this product

This is a repository for the final project of the PBL course at the University of Kobe. The project is about a railway knowledge system that utilizes AI technologies to support railway operations. The system is designed to help railway operators make decisions more efficiently and safely.

[Baseline.ipynb](./notebooks/Baseline.ipynb) is a notebook that shows the baseline model of the system with RAG-based retrieval and generation. The notebook demonstrates how the system retrieves relevant regulations and generates answers to questions.

[ReAct.ipynb](./notebooks/ReAct.ipynb) is a notebook that shows the improved model of the system with ReAct. The notebook demonstrates how the system uses the ReAct framework to improve question accuracy and answer complexity.

[CompareModel.ipynb](./notebooks/CompareModel.ipynb) is a notebook that shows the comparison of the baseline model and the improved model. The notebook demonstrates how the system's performance is evaluated based on question accuracy and answer complexity.

[Evaluation.ipynb](./notebooks/Evaluation.ipynb) is a notebook that shows the evaluation of the system. The notebook demonstrates how the system is evaluated based on question accuracy and answer complexity.

[CreateQuestion.ipynb](./notebooks/CreateQuestion.ipynb) is a notebook that shows how to create questions automatically using the accident case data. The notebook demonstrates how the system generates various types of questions for educational purposes.
